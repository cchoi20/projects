# projects

Here are some personal projects I've been working on.
Will add an index site when I have a reasonable amount to display.

Weather App: https://cchoi20.github.io/projects/Weather/Weather
Web app that uses WeatherAPI to let user search for details on the weather around the world. 
To search, enter a US Zipcode, UK Postcode, Canada Postalcode, IP address, Latitude/Longitude (decimal degree) or city name. 
Displays location's temperature, time, and current weather. 
Allows for multiple tabs of weather to be opened. 
Allows user to delete any unwanted tabs. 
Displays error message if location not found. 

PaintCC: https://cchoi20.github.io/projects/PaintCC/PaintCC
Site based on MS Paint. 
Currently has color selection, undo, clear, and save. 
For undo functionality, all strokes are saved in an array and the most recent is popped before re-rendering the canvas with all other strokes. 
Features-to-come mentioned in the Notes section under the canvas. 

Puzzle Game: WIP
Get a randomized grid, its size depending on what difficulty you select. 
Clicking will 'flip' the square, along with surrounding 4 squares. 
Goal is to get the whole grid flipped.
