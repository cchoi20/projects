# projects

Here are some personal projects I've been working on.
Will be adding an index page once I have a reasonable number of projects to display on it

PaintCC:
Site based on MS Paint
Currently has color selection, undo, clear, and save
For undo functionality, all strokes are saved in an array and the most recent is popped before re-rendering the canvas with all other strokes
Features-to-come mentioned in the Notes section under the canvas

Puzzle Game:
WIP
Get a randomized grid, depending on what difficulty you select
Clicking will 'flip' the square, along with surrounding 4 squares
Goal is to get the whole grid flipped
